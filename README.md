MNIST Digit Classification using Keras

Project Overview:
            
            This project demonstrates how to build and train a deep learning model using Keras for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
            It also includes code for loading and pre-processing custom images for classification, using OpenCV for image manipulation.

Model Architecture(NN):
                      
    Input Layer: 784 units (28x28 pixels flattened)
    Hidden Layer 1: 10 units, ReLU activation
    Hidden Layer 2: 30 units, ReLU activation
    Hidden Layer 3: 10 units, ReLU activation
    Output Layer: 10 units (for 10 digit classes), Softmax activation
Use Cases:

      Handwritten Digit Classification: This model can classify handwritten digits, useful in various digit recognition tasks (e.g., postal code recognition).
    Image Classification: The model architecture can be adapted for other image classification problems.
    Learning Tool: This project is a useful starting point for learning deep learning concepts such as neural networks, image processing, and classification tasks.
